# missing-element-in-a-array-for-sorted-and-unsorted-arrays
A C++ code snippet that contains several functions to find missing elements in different types of sorted and unsorted arrays. These functions can be used to find missing elements in various scenarios. I'll explain the purpose of each function and its behavior:
missing_number_in_an_sorted_array(int arr[], int n): This function is designed to find a missing number in a sorted array starting from 1. It calculates the expected sum of the elements from 1 to n using the formula s = (n * (n + 1)) / 2 and finds the missing element by subtracting the actual sum of the array from the expected sum.

missing_number_in_an_sorted_array_not_starting_from1(int arr[], int n): This function finds a missing number in a sorted array that does not necessarily start from 1. It calculates the difference between the first element and its index, then iterates through the array to find the first element where the difference does not match the calculated difference. The missing element is then calculated and printed.

missing_element_in_a_sequence_sorted_array(int arr[], int n): This function finds missing elements in a sorted array that represents a sequence. It calculates the difference between the first element and its index, then iterates through the array. Whenever it finds a gap, it prints the missing elements to fill the sequence.

missing_element_in_an_unsorted_array(int arr[], int n): This function finds missing elements in an unsorted array. It first finds the maximum element in the array, creates an auxiliary array of size max, and marks elements present in the input array. Then, it iterates through the auxiliary array to find and print the missing elements.

In the main() function, you've provided sample arrays and called the respective functions to demonstrate their functionality. Note that there's a comment marker // before the function calls, which means these functions are currently not called in the main() function. If you want to see the output of these functions, you need to uncomment the function calls.
